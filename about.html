    <p>The leading cause of death worldwide from organ rejection and failure is rooted in a simple yet profound issue: inequitable access to information and healthcare services. Solving this problem requires more than financial support or system upgrades. It calls for a new generation of well-rounded, innovative leaders committed to global change.</p>

    <p>Seeking to become one of these leaders, I reached out to SUNY Upstate Medical Hospital to further my knowledge and experience. At first, the responses were “We are full” or “You are too young.” But I kept pushing and eventually earned one of the youngest internship positions at the hospital. I flew to New York to shadow the head of transplant surgery.</p>

    <p>Right after arriving, I began to regret taking a red-eye flight. The moment I opened my hotel door, my phone buzzed with news that an organ had become available and the transplant team was heading into surgery. Excited, I called an Uber and rushed to the hospital. After completing the formalities, I put on my first set of scrubs. Words cannot describe how I felt. At sixteen, entering my junior year of high school, I never imagined I would scrub in to observe a transplant happening right before my eyes.</p>

    <p>Even though I was thrilled, I was also scared. Walking into that OR, surrounded by complex machines and people far more experienced than me, felt like entering a war zone. But to my surprise, it was the opposite. Instead of the tense, quiet scene I expected from movies, spicy tango music played from a speaker on the wall. Everyone was relaxed and confident, going about their work with ease. That’s when I realized these duties that seem so daunting to others had become normal for them.</p>

    <p>For the next three weeks, I shadowed the transplant head, met patients, and got to know the residents. When my time ended, I wanted to do more—even if from behind a computer screen. I connected with the research team and joined a retrospective study on antiviral therapies over the last twenty years and their effect on hepatitis C after transplantation. After months of work, Zoom meetings, and data analysis, we finished the paper. After final revisions, it was published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hepatology.</p>

    <p>You might be tired of hearing about my experience, but what I want to share is this: through effort and communication, I achieved more than I dreamed and explored parts of a field I hope to study further. That’s why I created this site. Vitals and Voices gives other students the chance I fought for—a place to express curiosity, explore passions, and contribute meaningfully to health and medicine. You don’t need a title or degree for your perspective to matter. Whether you have shadowed a surgeon, cared for a loved one, researched a health issue, or just have a story, your voice belongs here.</p>

    <p>This platform is more than a blog. It is a community of students who believe change begins with conversation, reflection sparks innovation, and storytelling is as vital as science. <strong>Whether you are here to read, write, or be inspired, welcome. Let’s build something meaningful together.</strong></p>
